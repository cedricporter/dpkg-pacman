# dpkg-pacman

Dpkg command used in Ubuntu for package management have a very ugly output,
especially in comparison to Arch's `pacman` or Gentoo's `emerge`. So I want to
write a little script to beautify its output,like this:

currently, I only finished a few commands,there is still a lot work to do. Any
suggestion and feedback will be welcome. Email :

# tools

This script use some system tools :

1. `grep`
2. `awk` 
3. `apt-cache`
4. `dpkg` (from Debian)
5. `dpkg-query` (from Debian)


# install

just download the script :

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hangyan/dpkg-pacman/master/pacman.sh

and put somewhere you think appropriate and `chmod a+x pacman.sh`.
